# Soiaporn model

Recreating the work of Soiaporn, K. et al., 2013. *Multilevel Bayesian framework for modeling the production, propagation and detection of ultra-high energy cosmic rays*. The Annals of Applied Statistics, 7(3), pp.1249â€“1285.

* `gibbs_implementation`: First attempted to recreate using the Gibbs sampling method described in the paper. This was not completely sucessful, could not find the problem yet.

* `stan_implementation`: Sucessfully recreated figures 4 and 5 from the original paper, final model has several advantages over the original implementation. The comparison is detailed in the pdf inside `stan_implementation/tex`
